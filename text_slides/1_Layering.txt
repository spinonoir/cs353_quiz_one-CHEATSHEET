A Web Request

User
• types URL into browser

Request

Browser
• sends request to server over the Internet
Response

Server
• responds with page contents

1 / 41

Under the Hood
How requests are sent

Browser
• gets address of the destination
Address of server

Your device OS sends
• the request to a nearby router
• … which hands it off to the next router
• in possibly a different ISP

Until
• the request reaches the destination

Path of packet

Under The Hood
How the server responds

Server
• knows your device’s address
• it’s in the request!

Sends response
• to its nearest router
• … which hands it off to another router

Your OS
• gets the response
• sends it to browser
• which displays web page

Under The Hood

This picture is highly simplified!

The Internet is a complex system with
• billions of users and devices
• millions of routers
• tens of thousands of ISPs
• hundreds of device types
• tens of communication media

How can we tame this complexity?

Taming Complexity: The Airline System
Another global, complex system

Ticketing
• agent or website handles purchase

At departure gate
• agent takes ticket and baggage

Baggage handlers, gate agents
• load you and baggage on flight

6 / 41

Taming Complexity: The Airline System
Each depends on the next

Airport tower
• handles takeoff and landing

Air traffic control
• routes plane through airspace

7 / 41

The Airline System and Layering
Helps simplify and understand a complex system

System decomposed into layers
• each layer provides a service
• … and uses the service provided by the
layer below

Examples
• baggage needs gate service
• plane cannot move without tower’s consent
• tower cannot permit taxiing without air
traffic control

8 / 41

The Airline System and Layering
How layering helps

Each layer
• does one thing
• e.g., handle baggage, route aircraft

Recursively, builds upon
• services provided by lower layers

Example
• baggage makes it from departure counter
• … to carousel at destination
• because loading/unloading got it on plane
• … tower got plane to land
• … air traffic control routed flight

Taming Internet Complexity
A possible decomposition into layers

Application
• hands off data to transport
• e.g., Web request

Transport
• converts data into packets
• reliably delivers data to destination

Packet delivery
• sends packets to destination
• but, by itself, may not be reliable

11 / 41

Organizing Communication into Layers

Layer decomposition
• application layer at the top
• physical layer at the bottom
• a general decomposition for the Internet
Communication Layers

12 / 41

Standardizing Layers
What are standards?

Standard
• an (international) agreement
• on some aspect of engineered or physical
systems

Examples
• times and time zones
• minimum lane width on roads
• telephone country codes

13 / 41

Standardizing Layers
Why do we need them?

Why do we need them?
• to interoperate
• e.g., everyone has the same notion of time
• or, cars built one place can be driven in
another

In our case
• so computers designed by different
manufacturers
• … can communicate

14 / 41

Standardizing Layers
How are standards set?

By agreement
• lots of discussion and debate!

At standards bodies
• International Standards Organization (ISO)
• Institution of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers (IEEE)
• Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
• International Telecommunication Union
(ITU)

15 / 41

Standardizing Layers
The ISO OSI Model

OSI Model
• Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)
• a model for how to layer computer
communications

Seven Layers
• similar to earlier decomposition
• today: session and presentation integrated
into application

16 / 41

Layers in Networking

Layer
• a part of a system
• … with well-defined interfaces to other parts

Each layer interacts
• only with layer above and layer below

Two layers interact
• only through the interface between them

Layers And Protocols

Communication
• between peer layers on different systems
• is defined by protocols

19 / 41

What Is A Protocol?
In the colloquial sense

Socio-cultural conventions
• that govern human interactions
• … and communications

Examples
• greeting someone before conversing
• (in some cultures) bowing before elders

20 / 41

What Is A Protocol?
In computer communication

Rules
• governing communication between
computers
• … in the form of messages

Specify
• message format and order
• actions upon message receipt

Examples of protocols
• TCP, IP, BGP, HTTP, SIP, …
• will study many of these in class

21 / 41

What Is A Protocol?
What is a message?

Message contains
• header and payload
• payload: content of message (e.g., web
page response)
• header: instructions on how to process
payload

Messages can be processed
• at router
• at sender or receiver

22 / 41

Protocols At Different Layers
How layers communicate

Key idea
• peer layers communicate
• each layer has one or more protocols
• a layer’s protocol uses a protocol from layer
below

Examples
• HTTP uses TCP
• TCP uses IP
• IP uses Ethernet

23 / 41

Protocols at Different Layers
Encapsulation

To use lower layer protocol

HTTP message in TCP payload

• add message as payload of lower-layer
protocol
• this idea is called encapsulation

Result: a protocol stack!

Internet Layering Implementation

• How does it relate to layering?
• The where, why and how
• Logical and physical views of layering

25 / 41

Layer Implementation
Where is a layer implemented?

Network
• has host and routers
• should all devices have all layers?
• might increase complexity

Just as
• ticketing at agent/online
• can’t buy a ticket during flight!

26 / 41

Layer Implementation
In the Internet

Key idea
• hosts implement all layers
• routers implement subset

Protocols implemented

Software

Hardware

• either in software or hardware
• (generally) higher layer protocols in software

27 / 41

Layer Implementation
Hosts

Must implement all layers
• since they run applications
• and application layer recursively
• … uses protocols in layers below

This means
• your laptop, mobile device, smart watch
• … run all protocol layers

28 / 41

Layer Implementation
Routers

Perform packet switching
• (recall architecture discussion)
• need only layers that switch packets

Network layer
• performs packet switching
• but uses layers below it
• … so these need to be in routers too!

29 / 41

Layer Implementation
Why this way?

Routers do less work
• can be cost-effective
• … and fast!

Helps network scale
• can build a global network
• that supports many applications
• at reasonable cost
• with good performance
• … and reliability

Not all networks designed this way!

30 / 41

Layer Implementation
Downsides of layering

Header overhead
• each layer adds headers
• must be transmitted on network
• adds overhead

Information Hiding
• upper layers don’t know
• … what lower layers are doing
• cross-layer information can be useful

31 / 41

Layer Implementation
A single network protocol

Explains why
• there is a single network layer protocol
• IP: Internet Protocol

All devices
• must ”talk” at least one common protocol
• cannot interoperate otherwise

32 / 41

Layer Implementation
A single network protocol

IP layer
• waist of an hour-glass
• ties together protocols above and below

Helped Internet evolve
• new transport and application protocols
• new datalink and physical layer protocols
• … but IP has remained (almost) unchanged

33 / 41

Layer Implementation
Where in the host?

Application
• Web server, browser, mail, games

Transport and network layer
• typically part of the operating system

Datalink and physical layer
• hardware/firmware/drivers

34 / 41

Layer Implementation
Aside: Switches vs. Routers

We use the terms
• interchangeably
• for most of the class

Historically
• a switch was an even simpler device
• ran only data link and physical layers
• performed local delivery

Layered Communication
The Logical View

• interacts with its peer layers

A

B

• … in another host

Logical communication
• application layer on A
• … thinks it is talking
• … to application layer on B

37 / 41

Layered Communication
The Physical View

What actually happens?
• on A, messages flow

A

B

• … downward through layers
• on B, upward

At routers
• up to the network layer
• … down again

layer above uses service

Protocol

Message formats, processing rules

Layered communication

Protocols at each layer,
encapsulation at lower layers

Layer implementation

Routers vs. hosts, OS vs application
