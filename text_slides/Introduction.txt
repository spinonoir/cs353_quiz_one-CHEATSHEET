A Data Network

Consists of
• links that interconnect
• … hosts and routers in order to

router

• … move data between hosts via routers
• hosts also called end systems
• routers sometimes called switches

link

host

The Internet
• A large, global, data network
• Focus of this class

The Internet

Connects many types of hosts

Today
• many devices Internet-connected
• even ones you might not have
thought were

A Macroscopic View
Who owns routers and links?

The Internet

Networks
• owned and managed by different entities
• e.g., USC, AT&T, Verizon

Collection of networks constitutes Internet

A Macroscopic View
Services

Search

Many services
• run on the Internet
• e.g., Zoom, Google search

Zoom

• implemented using software (e.g., apps)

7 / 49

A Macroscopic View
Services use the Internet

Search

Networks
• carry traffic between hosts
• e.g., video in Zoom call, query in search

A Macroscopic View

But how do networks communicate?

IP

Standardized communication
• the Internet Protocol
• a universal language for communicating
data
• described in RFC 791 (a standards
document)

The Need for Routers and Networks
Why not connect hosts directly?

Directly connecting N hosts
• to each other would require N2 links!
• much cheaper to have a shared network
• if not everyone communicates
• … with everyone else all the time!

Other networks built this way
• the road network

United airlines network

• the airline network

10 / 49

A Shared Network

Sharing!

Apps and Hosts
• share routers and links
• red and blue traffic go over same link

11 / 49

Two Ways to Share Switched Networks

Circuit Switching

Packet Switching

12 / 49

Circuit switching
What is it?

Circuit
• a connection between sender and receiver
• … with dedicated resources

Analogy
• multiple lanes between each pair of routers
• circuit uses one of these lanes at each hop

13 / 49

Circuit switching
How is it implemented?

Frequency-division multiplexing
• optical cables have different frequencies
• each circuit sent on a different frequency

Time-division multiplexing
• data from different connections
• .. sent in different time slots
Implementing Circuit Switching

Aside: Multiplexing and De-Multiplexing

Multiplexing
• combine multiple streams into a single
stream
• e.g., multiple connections into traffic on a
link

De-multiplexing
• disentangle multiple streams from single
stream
Implementing Circuit Switching

Packet Switching
What is a packet?

Packet
• a unit of data transmitted on network
• have a maximum size (L bits in figure)
• large transfers divided into multiple packets

16 / 49

Packet Switching

What do routers do with packets?

Store and Forward
• router waits to receive full packet
• stores it locally
• forwards it towards destination

17 / 49

Packet Switching
Queueing at routers

Queue
• a sequence of packets stored in a router
• … waiting to be transmitted

Queues form
• packets arrive faster than can be sent out
• if queue is large, router may drop packet

A packet-switched network can drop traﬀic

18 / 49

Which Is Better?
Pros and Cons

Packet switching

Circuit switching
Pros

Pros

• Predictable performance

• No circuit setup, faster transfers

• Simple/fast switching (once circuit
established)

• Easier failure handling, re-route on different
path

Cons
• Complexity and delay of circuit
setup/teardown
• If switch fails, its circuit(s) fails

Cons
• Packets can be dropped, impacting
performance
• Queueing can add delays

19 / 49

Statistical Multiplexing

Why the Internet uses packet switching

Computer communication is bursty
• applications/services have on/off behavior
• send traffic, stay silent, then send traffic again

Packet switched networks
• can more efficiently support bursty traffic
• because of statistical multiplexing

20 / 49

Statistical Multiplexing
An Example

Circuit switching
• can only support 10 users
• must build network for worst case
• (or must drop call)

Packet switching
• can support 35 users
• because probability that all 10 users
• … are active at the same time is 0.0004

21 / 49

Statistical Multiplexing
Overload

Statistical multiplexing
• with high probability, support more users
• (or, build a cheaper network)

Overload
• when more than 10 users arrive together
• refuse service, or degrade service

Statmux widely used in shared resources

23 / 49

What Can a Network Do to a Packet?
One of two things!

1

Delay the packet (e.g., queueing at router)

2

Drop the packet (e.g., when queue is full)

Both can reduce traﬀic rate

24 / 49

Measures of Network Performance

1

End-to-end delay

2

Packet loss rate

3

Throughput

25 / 49

End-to-end Delay

Let
• tsent be time sent

End-to-end delay

• trec time received

End-to-end delay
• trec − tsent

26 / 49

Components of End-to-end Delay
Delays within a single router

Components

Depends upon

Transmission (dtrans )

Link speed

Propagation (dprop )

Link distance

Queuing (dqueue )

Traffic on link

Processing (dproc )

CPU on switch

drouter = dqueue + dproc + dprop + dtrans

27 / 49

Transmission delay

Time to push all bits onto a link

Let
• L: packet size (length) in bits
• R: link transmission rate (bits per second)
• R is sometimes called link bandwidth
dtrans = L/R

28 / 49

Propagation delay

Time to send one bit from one router to next

Let
• d: length of physical link
• s: propagation speed (approx. speed of
light)
dprop = d/s

29 / 49

Packet Delay: Sending a 100-Byte Packet
The difference between propagation and transmission delay

Higher bandwidth → lower
transmission latency

30 / 49

Pipe Model of a Link
What is a model?

Model
• a mathematical or mental construct
• … that helps understand a physical process

Pipe model
• A link is not really a pipe (it doesn’t carry
water!)
• But we can use a pipe to understand link
behavior

Will use this later in the course

31 / 49

Pipe Model of a Link

Pipe
• width is link bandwidth
• length is time
• packet is a blob
• packet width is transmission time

Higher bandwidth
• means wider pipe
• … so smaller packet width
• (packet size stays the same)

Queueing

Why do queues form at routers?

If packets
• arrive faster than
• .. router can process
• .. they are placed into a queue

Queueing delay
• tp,e : time when packet p enters queue
• tp,l : time when it leaves queue
dqueue = tp,l − tp,e

Transient overload when packets are queued

Queueing

When can a router drop packets?

If router
• runs out of memory (buffer)
• … it may drop a packet

35 / 49

Queueing

Transient and Persistent Queues

Depends on
• Arrival rate at the queue
• Nature of arriving traffic (bursty or not?)
• Transmission rate of outgoing link

Transient Queues
• short-lived
• caused by bursty traffic

Persistent Queues
• (relatively) long-lived
• caused by high total arrival rate

36 / 49

Queueing Delay

Per-packet Queueing delay
• tp,e : time when packet p enters queue
• tp,l : time when it leaves queue
dqueue = tp,l − tp,e

Characterized by statistical measures
• Average queuing delay
• Variance of queuing delay
• Probability delay exceeds a threshold value

37 / 49

Aside: Queueing Theory
The mathematics underlying queueing

Complex mathematical discipline
• studies queue behavior
• under different arrival patterns
• … different numbers of queues
• … different queue processing (service)
times

Little’s Law, a basic result
• a powerful result

Terminology

Notation

Average Arrival Rate

λ

Average Wait Time

W

Average Length of Queue

L

• independent of arrival pattern
• and service times
L=λ×W

38 / 49

Processing Delay

Router processing
• read packet
• … maybe modify it slightly

dproc
• is usually neglible

39 / 49

End-to-End Delay

Delay at router
drouter = dqueue + dproc + dprop + dtrans

End-to-end delay
• sum of delays at each router
Σrouter drouter

40 / 49

End-to-End Delay
Why do delays add up?

Store-and-forward router
• waits to receive full packet
• before processing packet

41 / 49

Measures of Network Performance

1

End-to-end delay

2

Packet loss rate

3

Throughput

42 / 49

Packet Loss Rate

Let
• N be number of packets sent
• l be number of packets dropped (or lost)
• p be packet loss rate
p = l/N

43 / 49

Packet Loss Rate

Recovering from packet loss

Hosts/applications
• detect when a packet is lost
• retransmit lost packets to recover from loss

44 / 49

Throughput
Definitions

Throughput
• if B bits transferred from sender to receiver
• … in time t
• throughput = B/t

Instantaneous throughput
• when t is small
• … usually a few milliseconds

Average throughput
• t is longer
• … often the duration of a connection
• can be less than instantaneous throughput
45 / 49

Throughput

Dependence on link speed

Throughput limited by link speed
• Pipe model helps us understand this
• Cannot be larger than Rc or Rs

In this example
• throughput less than min Rs , Rc
• corresponding link is the bottleneck

46 / 49

Throughput

Throughput across a network

Traffic may share a link
• network gives fair share of link bandwidth
• in example, each connection get R/10 on
backbone

Where is the bottleneck?
• can be Rc (e.g., home network)
• or the backbone link
• or the server link Rs
